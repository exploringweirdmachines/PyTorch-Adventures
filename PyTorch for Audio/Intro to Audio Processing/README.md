# Intro To Audio Processing

To work with Audio data, there is a few things we need to explore! In this notebook we will see:

- A review of Fourier Transforms
- The Nyquist Rate and Aliasing
- Short Time Fourier Transforms for Spectrograms
- Mel Spectrograms
- Griffin-Lim for Magnitude Spectrogram inversion

This is an extremely quick crash course. Later we will take some time to implement all these algorithms (and more) from scratch, but we only see how to use ```torchaudio``` here, as all future implementations will use that!
