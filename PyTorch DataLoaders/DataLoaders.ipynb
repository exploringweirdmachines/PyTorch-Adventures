    "### Important Ideas to Keep in Mind\n",
    "- **Memory Constraints:** When we build a Dataset class we have to think about our hardware constraints. If we have a smaller CSV file, we can use Pandas to read it in and then index the dataframe to grab samples. The issue with this approach is that, the entire Pandas Dataframe is **read to memory**. This means if you have massive tabular datasets, Pandas is not the way to go. You would have to use a system that only loads samples of your tabular data to memory only when accessed. We will cover one such system that has been incredible called [Deep Lake](https://github.com/activeloopai/deeplake) in a future lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our Cats vs Dogs dataset, this is what our file directory looks like:\n",
    "\n",

    "- Store only a list of strings that indicate the path to each Image and then load the image only when accessed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of a Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset class will have three components:\n",
    "- **init**: Initialize the model class with everything you want to store as class variables\n",
    "- **len**: We have to tell the Dataset how many samples there are. When we go to grab a sample, it can grab all the samples from index 0 to index len\n",
    "- **getitem**: This is the block that does most of the heavy lifting. Basically, given some index between 0 and the length of data defined before, it will grab some sample.\n",

    "Lets say in our directories we have only 4 images in total (2 Cat and 2 Dog Images). Our **len** would then be 4 as we only have 4 images in total! The **getitem** will then use the indexes [0,1,2,3] to access these samples, so our goal in the getitem is to give the Dataset a way to load the image based on the sample number. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to do this is to store a list of filepaths to all of the images, and then when we access the filepath, we can load that image in! So we would first have to build this list of paths and store it to some class variable we can access later! \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This function should not be in the **getitem**. You want it to happen when the Dataset is being Initialized, otherwise we will build the list every time we grab a sample. The code in **getitem** runs **EVERY TIME WE GRAB A SAMPLE**, but **init** will only run once.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have a list of files, we have to set the **len**, which in this case would just be the length of training_files, or 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, when we start doing a forloop through our Dataset, the **getitem** function is run with an input of **idx**. More specifically, as we loop from 0 to 3 (our total samples of 4 as indicated from before), the idx returned for us to access in **getitem** can be utilized. For example, the first loop will return the index 0, and we can then take that and index our training files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the first iteration at the index 0 we have the filepath *data/Petimages/Dogs/111.jpg*.\n",
    "- In the second iteration at the index 1 we have the filepath *data/Petimages/Dogs/222.jpg*.\n",
    "- In the third iteration at the index 2 we have the filepath *data/Petimages/Cats/333.jpg*.\n",
    "- In the fourth iteration at the index 3 we have the filepath *data/Petimages/Cats/444.jpg*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we do the fourth iteration, we have done the entire length as indicated in **len** and the loop will end. Therefore in **getitem**, if we can index the filepath to each sample in this way, we can then load the image from the file and return the image as an array of numbers. Also, we can easily find the label of the image (Is it a Cat or Dog?) because the filepath includes \"Dogs\" and \"Cats\" in the name. Therefore we can also return from **getitem** some interger values like 0, if Dog is in the path, or 1 if Cat is in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arrays vs Tensors\n",
    "When we load an image we will use the PIL Image module that we imported above. All this module does is take a filepath and loads the image in the PIL format. We can then convert this to a numpy array, but numpy arrays dont work with PyTorch, so we need to convert to a tensor. From PyTorch Torchvision module, we have imported transform which has a ton of cool image transformations we can do (and will look at a bit later). The one we need right now is the **ToTensor()** function that can accept a PIL image (or Numpy Array) and convert to a Tensor that PyTorch models can work with!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8Bit Images \n",
    "Most images are stored in what is known as an 8bit format. Essentially each pixel in the image can take integer values in the range of [0,255]. Now the problem with this is, Deep Learning tends to prefer numbers scaled between [0,1], so we just need to scale our 8bit images down. One way is to just divide everything by 255, but the **ToTensor()** function will already handle this for us in the PIL -> Tensor transformation.\n",

    "Deep Learning models are extremly powerful because of their expressive nature and ability to model very complex, high dimensional relationships. This means that as we train on a model, how it is performing on the training data is deceptive. What I mean by this is, after training a model, you may get an astonishing 100% Accuracy! You think this model is incredible, but the second you start using it for real world prediction problems with examples your model has never seen, you see that it doesn't perform accurately at all.\n",

To have a fair comparison, we have to train our data on some of the labeled data we have, but keep a small part of it for validation. The model will never optimize on the Validation but just inference to see how well it performs on data it has never seen. We will get into that in a future lesson, but for now, how do we setup our DataLoader to be able to do this?\n",

We saw previously that our datset has about 25000 samples, so what we want to do is give 90 percent of our samples for training and the remaining 10 percent for validation. We will then load each of these datasets into our dataloaders."

    "## Data Collator\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see above, we are able to return tokenized forms for each sentence, but they are all different lengths! This makes sense as different sentences are different lengths so we will append  the **<PAD>** token to each of our samples to make sure a batch is the same length. We could have, in the Dataset Class, made it such that we set a default length of 3000 tokens, and sentences that are longer will be cut to that size. The problem with this is, if we have samples that are much shorter than 3000, then we will have unecessary amounts of padding. Instead, we should pad every batch, so the maximum amount of padding would only go to the longest sample in a specific batch. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "To do this we will take a look at the **collate_fn** option in the DataLoader. By default, the **collate_fn** expects everything to be of the same size and will stack them together, but that wont work. We will instead write our own function that will first pad all the samples to the longest sample in a batch and then stack them!\n",
    "    \n",
    "To do this, we wil use the pad_sequence fucntion give in PyTorch found in the utils for their RNN function. Here is a sample from the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.rnn.pad_sequence.html) that explains how it works! As you can see we give three different tensors of different sizes, and it padds sequences along the first dimension. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Also, when it comes to PyTorch we can have our data tensors in two formats:\n",

    "Sequence First [sequence length x batch x ...]\n",
    "Batch First [batch x sequence length x ...]\n",
