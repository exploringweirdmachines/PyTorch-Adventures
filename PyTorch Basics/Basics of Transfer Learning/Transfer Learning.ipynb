    "# Transfer Learning and PreTrained Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into building a ton of models, I want to first talk about one of the coolest aspects of Deep Learning: **Transfer Learning**. As we have seen in the [Intro to PyTorch](https://github.com/priyammaz/HAL-DL-From-Scratch/tree/main/Intro%20to%20PyTorch), a Deep Learning model is really just a structured bag of parameters. In the Linear Regression example, we had only two parameters, a weight $W_1$ and a Bias $W_0$. The only models we can create by multiplying and adding numbers together is a linear model. The Dense MNIST model we then made after was a deeper model with more parameters and connections, but we were still only multiplying and adding numbers together, therefore we can only represent a linear relationship. To fix this we then added in some ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation functions that would allow us to introduce non-linearity to our model! All these weights that are randomly initialized when we define the model are then optimized and tuned so we have the least error between our predictions and true value. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we took our model and saved the parameters that define it, this would be known as a **pre-trained** model. Transfer learning is then the idea that, if we already have a model that can predict handwritten digits very well (0 through 9), and we have a new dataset of the lowercase alphabet (a through z), do we really need to train a new model from scratch? Or can we just grab our pre-trained model and its already optimized weights and finetune it to the new dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively you can think about it this way. Lets say we show a kid some pictures of dogs and cats (like the dataset we are working on). After we show them some images of these dogs and cats, they will be able to classify them pretty well all on their own! Now we want to give them a new task, classify between tigers and wolves. Obviously tigers are not the same as cats and wolves are not the same as dogs, but they do share a bunch of similarities right? So the kid would then use their previous knowledge (The **pre-trained** model) and exapand it to be able to do this new task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AlexNet and Convolutions\n",
    "We will be skipping ahead a bit here. In the next lesson, PyTorch for Vision, we will be covering in detail the ideas for convolutions and why they are much better that Dense Linear layers for Images. For now, pretend the model we will use is some black box that takes in an image, and outputs some probabilities of belonging to different classes. The specific model we will look at is AlexNet, which was probably the first real evidence of the power of deep learning in 2012. It was trained on the ImageNet task (predict across 1000 classes of images) and beat all other methods by a significant margin. We will be loading a PyTorch defined version of this model, but don't worry, we will implement this entire model from scratch in the next lesson! I am just trying to offer some intuition for Deep Learning before we get into the weeds!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## More Intution about Deep Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, the reason it is called \"Deep\" Learning is because the model physically has depth and many layers of computation. Because of this we actually get some interesting properties!\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/priyammaz/HAL-DL-From-Scratch/main/src/visuals/conv_feature_extracts.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "[credit](https://anhvnn.wordpress.com/2018/02/01/deep-learning-computer-vision-and-convolutional-neural-networks/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common image you will see when exploring Deep Learning. You can see that earlier features that are learned are focused on simple things to find in an image, like edges, lines, etc... Regardless of the Image problem at hand, we always have to detect these features, so the underlying weights in a pretrained model that encode this can easily be used. As we move forward through the model, the extracted features in the image become much more specific to the dataset, and in this case there is some type of face detection. It is really cool though that convolutions (Again a black box that does some type of image processing) can extract abstract features at such a high level!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets say we want to use this pretrained model and now detect Dogs instead. Well on its own, this model would do poorly as it is optimized to find human faces! But also the intial layers that do low level image feautures are probably fine to leave alone. Therefore, the typical strategy is to keep the earlier parts of the model static (don't allow gradient updates) and then finetune the later layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some benefits for this:\n",
    "- We can pretrain a model on a giant dataset, and then finetune it to a similar problem that we have limited data for\n",
    "- We can control and avoid problems like overfitting better"

    "Pretrained models allow us to \"Transfer\" knowledge from a previous task to a new one. The main benefits to this are as follows:\n",
    "- Less data needed to train model and allows us to work on niche tasks even with these expressive datasets\n",
    "- Less concern for Overfitting. Typically, if you train a large model on a small dataset, it will quickly memorize the data. Instead, we can train just a small part of the model and keep the rest as a feature extractor. \n",
    "- Less compute! Deep Learning takes long enough already to train. Atleast we have less parameters to do gradient updating on, so it saves us quite a bit of compute. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretrained models are the current future for deep learning. It has become the gold standard to take large language, vision, speech, and any other modality and transfer it to new tasks. Even more interesting is, the models have become so powerful, they can often transfer to completely unrelated tasks (Using NLP based models for Protein Analysis). This technique also greatly democratizes Deep Learning to many because if the models are easier to train and dont require entire data centers like the Pretraining stage did, then we can all enjoy solving the problems we are interested in!"
