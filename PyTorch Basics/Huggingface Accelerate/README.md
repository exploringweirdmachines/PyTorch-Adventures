# ðŸ¤— Huggingface Accelerate 

To train larger models efficiently, we need to be able to utilize multiple GPUs at a time. I used to use regular PyTorch DDP, but these days I basically just use Huggingface Accelerate just due to the convenience. We will be looking at an example of training ResNet50 on the ImageNet dataset, following as close as I can the [training recipie](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/classification#resnet) provided by PyTorch. What we will learn here is:

- Controlling our scripts through the command line using [Argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
- Using Huggingface Accelerate to train on multiple GPUs
- Incorporating a learning rate scheduler
- Using gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes
- Gathering metrics across GPUs
- Checkpointing/Resuming model training
- Training logs stored in [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)

### Download ImageNet Dataset
To run this script, first downlod the ImageNet dataset. To do this you can just follow the [instructions from Google](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/imagenet-setup) to set up the training and validation data!

**Alternative:**

[Here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/antoinebrl/7d00d5cb6c95ef194c737392ef7e476a/raw/74a1246c9254676e19c106ae67e57c9a174ff5de/prepare.sh) is a really convenient script and instructions that can take the `ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar` and `ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar` files you download from the [official Imagenet website](https://image-net.org/download.php). Just follow the instructions and download the data, just keep track of the path to where you save the data as we will need that later!

### Setup Training Environment
 Next create a folder for where you want to store your checkpoints. Also verify that you have Accelerate installed and go through the prompts when you enter ```accelerate config``` to let it know information about the system and what resources you want to use. You can also run ``accelerate test`` to verify the installation and access to the identified resources Pass the path to your imagenet data and working directory to the command below and you are good to go!
```
accelerate launch train.py --experiment_name="ResNet50" \
                           --path_to_data="<PATH_TO_IMAGENET_ROOT>" \
                           --working_directory="<PATH_TO_WORK_DIR>" \
                           --num_classes=1000 \
                           --epochs=90 \
                           --save_checkpoint_interval=2 \
                           --batch_size=512 \
                           --gradient_accumulation_steps=1 \
                           --learning_rate=0.1 \
                           --weight_decay=1e-4 \
                           --momentum=0.9 \
                           --step_lr_decay=0.1 \
                           --lr_step_size=30 \
                           --warmup_epochs=5 \
                           --lr_warmup_start_factor=0.1 \
                           --max_grad_norm=1.0 \
                           --img_size=224 \
                           --num_workers=18
```

Here are the [results](https://api.wandb.ai/links/exploratorydataadventure/q8on5kzo) from the training run stored in Weights and Biases! This model reached about a 75% Top-1 Accuracy on Imagenet, which is just shy of the 76% that PyTorch reports on their website. Theres probably something small missing thats causing that discrepancy, but this is enough to learn from!
