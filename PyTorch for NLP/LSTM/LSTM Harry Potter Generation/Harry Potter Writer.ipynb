    "The following example will be a Word Level tokenization but we will implement Character Level to save on computation!\n",
    "\n",
    "First we tokenize our text:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you\" -> [\"Strange\", \"how\", \"nearsighted\", \"being\", \"invisible\", \"can\", \"make\", \"you ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now our goal is, we want to pass in the word \"Strange\" to our model and then predict \"how\". We will then pass in the word \"how\" and hope to predict \"nearsighted\", and so on! Therefore, we can setup our data as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "input = [\"Strange\", \"how\", \"nearsighted\", \"being\", \"invisible\", \"can\", \"make\"]\n",
    "label = [\"how\", \"nearsighted\", \"being\", \"invisible\", \"can\", \"make\", \"you\"]\n",

We can then just sample some predetermined sequence length from this dataset, stack many of them together as a batch, and then train!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Character Level Modeling\n",
    "Ideally we would use N-Grams or more powerful tokenization, but the purpose here is to again demonstrate the capabilities of LSTM's without a huge resource burden! If you want to try more advanced tokenizers for  you data, feel free to update the code to use [TikToken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) that is used often with GPT type models. Our goal will be to predict a character given a previous character and see what kind of output we can expect!\n",

Instead of just taking the character that has the highest probability, we will sample from a multinomial distribution with the given probabilities.

If we expand it and have more options and role a dice (which has 6 sides) if we sample from a multinomial distribution once we would get one of the sides. For our problem, we will be passing in a probability vector of length num_characters, and we will randomly sample to see what character we get. Again, this should help with both getting more unique outputs and allow the model to explore more possibilities than a simple Argmax."
