# PyTorch for Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is one of the coolest types of learning methods out there, where instead of learning from input/output pairs like we typically do in supervised learning, we instead learn from experience. This repository is called PyTorch-Adventures, but I can't really move onto Deep Reinforcement Learning without setting the stage with more traditional RL methods. So we will break this section into a few parts:

### [Intro to Reinforcement Learning](Intro%20to%20Reinforcement%20Learning)

In this section, we will explore traditional RL methods of solving simple Environments. The main purpose for this is, it'll allow us to set the stage for defining common terms used in RL as well as explore the Bellman Equation in depth! This will have two parts, where we explore Model-Based Learning where the environment information is provided through the Markov Decision Process, and then Model-Free when that information is unavailable. 

  - Model-Based Learning
    - Policy Iteration
    - Value Iteration
  - Model-Free Learning
    - Temporal Difference Learning
    - SARSA
    - Q Learning
  
### Beginner Deep Reinforcement Learning

Now that we understand everything regarding some of the basic methods of solving RL problems, we can apply Neural Networks to estimate the State/Action pair relationship. The following will be some of the simple ways we can do this, while leveraging the previously explored techniques. 

  - Deep-Q Learning
  - Double Deep-Q Learning
  - Dueling Deep-Q Learning
  - Prioritized Experience Replay
