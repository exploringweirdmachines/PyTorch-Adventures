# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is one of the coolest types of learning methods out there, where instead of learning from input/output pairs like we typically do in supervised learning, we instead learn from experience. This repository is called PyTorch-Adventures, but I can't really move onto Deep Reinforcement Learning without setting the stage with more traditional RL methods.
