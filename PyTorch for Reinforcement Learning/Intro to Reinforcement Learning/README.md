# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is one of the coolest types of learning methods out there, where instead of learning from input/output pairs like we typically do in supervised learning, we instead learn from experience. This repository all about Neural Networks, but I can't really move onto Deep Reinforcement Learning without setting the stage with more traditional RL methods.

What we will explore is:

- Model Based Learning
  - Policy Iteration
  - Value Iteration

- Model Free Learning
  - Monte Carlo
  - TD Learning
  - SARSA
  - Q Learning
