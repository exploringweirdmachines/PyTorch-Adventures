            batch_heads, windows, window_len, embed_dim = x.shape

            ### Now a problem, if we want for every window in Q, we want to attend to not only the
            ### cooresponding window in K,V but also the previous window, then when we are on the very 
            ### first window, we have nothing to grab beforehand, therefore, we need to pad our data by
            ### The number of windows we want to grab before and after 
    
            ### in practice our tensor has n windows, if we want to grab one before and one after for each of them, 
            ### we need to have n+2 windows, where we have an entire padded window on the left and another on the right ###
            pad = (0,0,0,0,backward,forward)

        elif x.dim() == 3:

            ### This is incase our tensor doesnt have an embed dim (like for our index tensor we use) ###
            batch_head_dim, windows, window_len = x.shape
            pad = (0,0,backward,forward)

        ### Now we can go ahead and pad our tensor and add in those extra pad buckets ###
        x = torch.nn.functional.pad(x, pad=pad, value=pad_value)

        ### Lastly we have to now put it all together! Lets pretend we split our sequence in to 4 buckets and each bucket is of length 512. ###
        ### If we want to attend to the previous bucket, the corresponding bucket, and the future bucket, that means the 512 tokens in our Query ###
        ### Needs to attend to 3*512 tokens in our Keys. So how can we do this? Just some simple indexing will solve this!

        ### Lets allow our 4 buckets in our queries to have indexes [0,1,2,3]. If we are looking backward and forward by 1, then we have a single pad bucket
        ### on either side of our original buckets, so now we will have the buckets that look like [<PAD>,0,1,2,3,<PAD>] and with padded indexes [0,1,2,3,4,5].
        ### And again the data in the slice of our padded indexes [1,2,3,4] is identical to the original indexes [0,1,2,3]

        ### So in our original indexes [0,1,2,3], we want this pattern:
        ### bucket 0 attends to [<PAD>,0,1]  which have our padded indexes of [0,1,2]
        ### bucket 1 attends to [0,1,2] which have our padded indexes of [1,2,3]
        ### bucket 2 attends to [1,2,3] which have our padded indexes of [2,3,4]
        ### bucket 3 attends to [2,3,<PAD>] which have our padded indexes of [3,4,5]

        ### So we see the pattern then, for every index in our original buckets [0,1,2,3], we want
        ### the index to index + forward + backward
        
        ### At original index 0, we want indexes 0 to 0+1+1=2 in our padded indexes
        ### At original index 1, we want indexes 1 to 1+1+1=3 in our padded indexes
        ### At original index 2, we want indexes 2 to 2+1+1=4 in our padded indexes
        ### At original index 3, we want indexes 3 to 3+1+1=5 in our padded indexes
        
        ### Lastly, if we want to grab a slice of our buckets from bucket 0 to bucket 2, we actually need to
        ### grab bucket 0 to bucket 3, as python is not right inclusive, that is why you see the extra end_windows+1 term

        gathered = []
        for i in range(windows):

            ### Grab the starting and end window index ###
            start_window = i
            end_window = i + forward + backward

            ### Slice the windows (with the extra +1 term because python isnt right inclusive ###
            grabbed_windows = x[:, start_window:end_window+1]

            ### Each grabbed_windows is of size (Batch_heads x forward+backward+1 x window_size x embed_dim ###
            ### forward+backward+1 is the number of consective buckets we want to concat together ###
            ### If we are looking forward and backward by 1, then we only have 3 consective buckets each of size 512 in our case ###
            ### We can put this all together and flatten to create a single sequence of length 3*512=1536 ###
            ### We then need to unsqueeze to add the bucket dimension back to concat on in the future, so the final shape of a single
            ### grabbed_window is (Batch x 1 x num_buckets*window_length x embed_dim)
            grabbed_windows = grabbed_windows.flatten(1,2).unsqueeze(1)
            gathered.append(grabbed_windows)

        ### What we have now is for each input bucket (we have 4 in the example), we grabbed the consecutive buckets and stuck them together ###
        ### so we have a list of 4 tensors, each of which are (Batch x 1 x num_buckets*window_length x embed_dim). We can then concat them all ###
        ### together on the first dimension to give us a final (Batch x 4 x num_buckets*window_length x embed_dim). ###
        ### This gives us exactly what we want then! For each input bucket, we grabbed backward number of buckets, forward number of buckets, and ###
        ### stacked it all together so when we compute attention, our input queries have a larger receptive field looking into neighboring buckets ###

        ### Store final seq len (same as orig_seq_len if no padded was needed) ###
        seq_len = q.shape[1]

        ### Compute Number of Windows ###

        bucketed_v = v.reshape(batch*self.num_heads, num_windows, self.window_size, self.head_dim)

        ### Now for the fun part!!! What we have is our queries as (B*num_heads x num_windows x window_size x head_dim). ###
        ### Our Keys and Values are also the same shape currently ###
        ### So if we did attention directly, on a per-window basis, then we will repeat a window_size ** 2 operation, num_windows times ###
        ### Although, we can expand the receptive field a little as well, what if we want one window in our query to look at not only the ###
        ### cooresponding window in the keys, but also the window before and after? Or two windows before and after? Or only the window before to keep causality? ###
        ### Therefore, we need to expand our keys and values from (B*num_heads x num_windows x window_size x head_dim) to (B*num_heads x num_windows x k*window_size x head_dim)
        ### where k is how many consective windows we want to compute attention against. 
        bucketed_k = self.collect_windows(bucketed_k, self.look_backward, self.look_forward)
        bucketed_v = self.collect_windows(bucketed_v, self.look_backward, self.look_forward)

        ### Create Padding Mask where collected_bucketed_t is -1 ### 
        bucket_pad_mask = (collected_bucketed_t == -1)

        ### Compute Raw Scores between our Q and K ###
        ### Again, remember Q has 4 buckets in our example and each bucket is of length 512 ###
        ### It is being attended to by the previous bucket and the future bucket, so we have 512 * 3 token in our keys ###
        ### This means our attention matrix should be of size 512 x 1536 ###
        attention_scores = bucketed_q @ bucketed_k.transpose(-1,-2)

        ### Our Bucket mask has shape (1 x num_buckets (4) x key length (1536) ###
        ### Our attention scores are (batch_heads x num_buckets (4) x query_length (512) x key_length (1536) ###
        ### The pad masks needs to repeat for all the queries as well, as we dont need the padded key for any of queries ###
        ### So lets add a dimension and repeat our mask so we have a final mask of (1 x num_buckets (4) x query_length (512) x key_length (1536) ###
        ### Because this mask can be broadcasted across our attention mask we can use it to fill with -inf before softmax ###
        bucket_pad_mask = bucket_pad_mask.unsqueeze(-2).repeat(1,1,self.window_size,1)

        ### For the same reason as above, lets expand and repeat the collected_bucketed_t so we know for every query index, which keys were computed against ###
        collected_bucketed_t = collected_bucketed_t.unsqueeze(-2).repeat(1,1,self.window_size,1)

        ### If we are Non Causal then we need to deal with looking forward and backward ###
        if not self.causal:
     
            ### Now this is optional, but technically we are overcomputing right now ###
            ### We are attending by blocks, but if our window size is 3 and we are looking forward and backward by a single block ###
            ### this mean the first token (index 0) is attending to 3 pad tokens before and 6 tokens going forward. If we want our window ###
            ### to be exactly 3 before and 3 after in each index, then we are overcomputing too many! In this figure lets also say the input lenght is 
            ### 12, so the 12 tokens were chunked into 4 chunks each of size 3 
    
            ### Our collected_bucketed_t is of the shape (1 x Bucket x window_size x (forward+backward+1)*window_size
            ### This is what it looks like:
            # tensor([[[[-1, -1, -1,  0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
            #           [-1, -1, -1,  0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
            #           [-1, -1, -1,  0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5]],

            #           [ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8]],

            #          [[ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, -1, -1, -1],
            #           [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, -1, -1, -1],
            #           [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, -1, -1, -1]]]])
    
            ### The above tensor shows that:
            ### Query index [0,1,2] was mulitplied by key index [-1-1-1,0,1,2,3,4,5]
            ### Query index [3,4,5] was mulitplied by key index [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
            ### Query index [6,7,8] was mulitplied by key index [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
            ### Query index [9,10,11] was mulitplied by key index [6,7,8,9,10,11,-1,-1,-1]
            ### Where -1 is just our chunk padding explained `collect_windows`
            
            ### So for query index 0 we compute again against these key indexes:
            ### [-1,-1,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5]
            ### This means query 0 is computing against 3 tokens before it, but 5 tokens after it
            ### technically all we want to do is compute 3 tokens before (-1,-1,-1) and 3 tokens after (1,2,3), so we need to mask token 4 and 5
    
            ### For query index 1, we again compute against the same key indexes as query index 0:
            ### [-1,-1,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5]
            ### What we really want is to attend to 3 tokens before (-1,-1,0) and 3 tokens after 1 (2,3,4), so we need to mask token 5 only
    
            ### So how can we do this operation quickly? We can create a repeated query index first, so for every row in in every bucket, we can ###
            ### have a row of the index of which query was being multiplied ###
            
            ### This is what the repeated_query_index looks like
